# numberGuess
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This Python program is an exciting game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Test your guessing skills and see if you can hit the jackpot!

# How to Play
    The program will randomly select a number between a predefined range (e.g., 1 and 100).

    Your task is to guess the correct number within that range.

    Enter your guess when prompted by the program.

    The program will provide you with feedback on your guess:
    1. If your guess is correct, you win!
    2. If your guess is incorrect, the program will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low.
    3. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or decide to quit the game.
